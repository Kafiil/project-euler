# Problem 2 
## Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with `1` and `2`, the first `10` terms will be:

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`


## Question
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution

```javascript
fibannaciNumbers = limit => {
    let result = [1, 2];

    let a = 1; b = 2; c = 0;

    while (a + b < limit) {
        c = a + b;
        b = c;
        a = c - a;
        result.push(c);

    }
    return result;
}

main = () => fibannaciNumbers(4000000).filter(i => i % 2 == 0).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
```
